Matlab code for drift diffusion semiconductor modelling

The code implements the coupled set of equations which consists of a non-linear Poisson equation and two advection diffusion equations which must be stabilised to avoid spurious oscillations in the results. 

The code implements residual-free basis functions and StreamLine UpWind Petrov Galerkin formulations.

A variety of meshes are provided for the 2D case.
